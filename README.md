## 🧾 Project Summary  
As part of my LSE coursework, I analysed customer and marketing data from **2Market**, a global supermarket brand. The objective was to provide business insights on customer demographics, ad channel performance, and product sales. Deliverables included a technical report, interactive dashboard, and a business presentation tailored for marketing stakeholders.

## ❓ Business Problem  
2Market wanted to refine its marketing strategy with data-backed answers to:
- Who are our most valuable customers?
- Which advertising channels convert best?
- Which products perform best—and for whom?

## ⚙️ Analytical Approach Highlights  
- **Cleaned and pre-processed data**: Consolidated age, income, and marital status categories, handled outliers with justification, and ensured consistency across datasets.
- **SQL analysis**: Joined datasets on customer ID. Queried demographic trends, product sales by segment, and advertising channel conversions to validate Tableau output.
- **Actionable dashboards**: Built segmented Tableau dashboards by age, income, country, and channel. Emphasis was placed on clarity and business usability.
- **Strategic alignment**: Tied insights back to 2Market’s goals—boosting sales, improving ad ROI, and guiding budget reallocation across channels.
